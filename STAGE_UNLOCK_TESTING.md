## Testing Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Test 1: First Stage Always Unlocked

**Objective**: Verify that Stage 1 is ALWAYS unlocked (status: 'current') regardless of progress

**Steps**:
1. Open app ‚Üí Go to Home Screen
2. Click "üê± Beginner (Level 1)"
3. Look at Stage 1: "‡∏û‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏ç‡∏ä‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ê‡∏≤‡∏ô ‡∏Å-‡∏Æ"

**Expected Result**:
- Status badge shows: `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Current` (blue)
- Stage card is NOT grayed out
- Card is clickable and can start the game

**Console Output**:
```
üìç Stage 1 (First): ‡∏û‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏ç‡∏ä‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ê‡∏≤‡∏ô ‡∏Å-‡∏Æ - Status: current
```

### ‚úÖ Test 2: Stage 2 Locked Initially

**Objective**: Verify that Stage 2 is locked until Stage 1 is completed

**Steps**:
1. DON'T play Stage 1 yet
2. Look at Stage 2: "‡∏™‡∏£‡∏∞ 32 ‡∏ï‡∏±‡∏ß"

**Expected Result**:
- Status badge shows: `üîí Locked` (gray)
- Stage card is grayed out (opacity: 0.5)
- Card is NOT clickable
- Clicking it shows alert: "Complete the previous stage to unlock this one."

**Console Output**:
```
üìç Stage 2 (Locked): ‡∏™‡∏£‡∏∞ 32 ‡∏ï‡∏±‡∏ß - Status: locked (prev accuracy: 0%)
```

---

### ‚úÖ Test 3: Stage 2 Unlocks After Stage 1 Completion (>= 70%)

**Objective**: Verify that Stage 2 unlocks when Stage 1 reaches 70% accuracy

**Steps**:
1. Click on Stage 1: "‡∏û‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏ç‡∏ä‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ê‡∏≤‡∏ô ‡∏Å-‡∏Æ"
2. Complete the game (answer questions until you get ~70% accuracy)
3. Finish the game
4. Go back to Level 1 (click back or navigate back)

**Expected Result**:
- Go back to Beginner level
- Stage 1 now shows: `‚úÖ Done` (green)
- Stage 2 now shows: `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Current` (blue) - UNLOCKED!
- You can now click on Stage 2

**Console Output**:
```
üìç Stage 1 (First): ‡∏û‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏ç‡∏ä‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ê‡∏≤‡∏ô ‡∏Å-‡∏Æ - Status: done
üìç Stage 2 (Unlocked): ‡∏™‡∏£‡∏∞ 32 ‡∏ï‡∏±‡∏ß - Status: current
```

### ‚úÖ Test 4: Debug Flag Override (Stage 3)

**Objective**: Verify that the DEBUG flag forces Stage 3 unlock in Level 1

**Current State**: `DEBUG_UNLOCK_STAGE_3_GREETINGS = true`

**Steps**:
1. Open Level 1 Beginner
2. Look at Stage 3: "‡∏Ñ‡∏≥‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏¢"

**Expected Result**:
- Stage 3 shows: `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Current` (blue) - UNLOCKED (even if Stage 2 not completed!)
- You can click and play this stage
- This is for testing/demo purposes only

**Console Output**:
```
üìç Stage 3 (Debug unlock): ‡∏Ñ‡∏≥‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏¢ - Status: current
```

**Note**: When ready for production, change line 21 in `LevelStage.js`:
```javascript
const DEBUG_UNLOCK_STAGE_3_GREETINGS = false;  // Disable debug mode
```

### ‚úÖ Test 5: Level Selection (Manual Fallback)

**Objective**: Verify that if levelId is not passed, user can manually select level

**Steps** (Simulate missing levelId):
1. Modify navigation to NOT pass levelId: `navigation.navigate('LevelStage')`
2. LevelStage screen loads
3. Should see: "Select a Level" with three buttons

**Expected Result**:
- Shows "Select a Level" screen
- Three buttons: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- Clicking any button shows that level's stages
- Go Back button returns to Home

**Console Output**:
```
üéØ LevelStage Component Debug:
   paramLevelId: undefined
   selectedLevelId: null
   levelId: null
   levelConfig exists: false
```

### ‚úÖ Test 8: Console Debugging

**Objective**: Verify debug logs appear in console

**Steps**:
1. Open Level 1 Beginner
2. Open Xcode console or device console
3. Watch for debug messages

**Expected Console Output**:
```
üéØ LevelStage Component Debug:
   paramLevelId: 1
   selectedLevelId: null
   levelId: 1
   levelConfig exists: true

üìç Stage 1 (First): ‡∏û‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏ç‡∏ä‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ê‡∏≤‡∏ô ‡∏Å-‡∏Æ - Status: current
üìç Stage 2 (Locked): ‡∏™‡∏£‡∏∞ 32 ‡∏ï‡∏±‡∏ß - Status: locked (prev accuracy: 0%)
üìç Stage 3 (Debug unlock): ‡∏Ñ‡∏≥‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏¢ - Status: current
üìç Stage 4 (Locked): ‡∏™‡∏¥‡πà‡∏á‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏ï‡∏±‡∏ß - Status: locked (prev accuracy: 0%)
üìç Stage 5 (Locked): ‡∏£‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏¢ - Status: locked (prev accuracy: 0%)
‚úÖ Loaded 5 stages for Level 1
```

## Edge Cases to Test

### Case 1: Stage with < 70% Accuracy
- Complete a stage with 65% accuracy
- Next stage should remain LOCKED
- Console shows: "prev accuracy: 65%"

### Case 2: Navigation Back
- Play a stage
- Go back to level screen
- Stage progress should be updated
- Check console for latest status

### Case 3: Multiple Level Switches
- Go to Level 1 ‚Üí Go back ‚Üí Go to Level 2 ‚Üí Go back ‚Üí Go to Level 1
- Each level should load fresh without data mixing
- Console should show correct levelId for each

### Case 4: Rapidly Clicking Buttons
- Click multiple level buttons quickly
- App should handle gracefully without crashes
- Should eventually settle on last clicked level

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: All stages showing as locked
**Solution**: 
- Check `DEBUG_UNLOCK_STAGE_3_GREETINGS` flag
- Verify Stage 1 status in console
- Check AsyncStorage has valid progress data

### Issue: Stage 1 shows as locked
**Solution**: This should NEVER happen!
- Check line 273-275 in LevelStage.js
- Verify `if (index === 0)` logic
- File a bug if this occurs

### Issue: Clicking stage does nothing
**Solution**:
- Check console for navigation errors
- Verify gameScreen property in LEVEL_CONFIG
- Check if game component exists and is registered

### Issue: Progress not saving
**Solution**:
- Check AsyncStorage keys match
- Verify game save logic in each game component
- Check for console errors after finishing game

## Performance Notes

- Stage loading should complete in < 500ms
- Async progress fetching happens in parallel
- Console output helps identify slow stages
- Monitor memory usage when switching levels frequently
